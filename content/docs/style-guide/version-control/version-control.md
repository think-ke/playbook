**Version Control Best Practices for the Tech Innovators Network (THiNK)**
*Adapted from Git, GitHub, and VSCode workflows to streamline collaboration, ML projects, and code quality.*

---  

### **1. Introduction**
Version control isn‚Äôt just about tracking changes‚Äîit‚Äôs the backbone of collaboration, especially when juggling ML models, websites, databases, and web apps. At THiNK, we use **Git** for version control, **GitHub** for collaboration, and **VSCode** to supercharge our workflow. Whether you‚Äôre training a model, deploying an app, or fixing a bug, these practices ensure your work is organized, traceable, and secure.

### **2. Git Workflow Basics**
**The THiNK Workflow**
1. **Branch Like a Boss**:
   - Work in **feature branches** (e.g., `feat/rag-app-search` or `fix/model-deployment-bug`).
   - Use **descriptive names** to clarify the branch‚Äôs purpose.

2. **Commit Early, Commit Often**:
   - Make **atomic commits**‚Äîfocus each commit on a single task (e.g., *‚ÄúAdd training script for v2 model‚Äù*).
   - Use **commit prefixes** to categorize changes (see examples below).

3. **Pull Requests (PRs)**:
   - Open a PR when your branch is ready for review.
   - Include testing instructions (e.g., *‚ÄúRun `npm test` to validate model accuracy‚Äù*).

4. **Merge Strategically**:
   - Merge PRs only after approval and CI/CD checks pass.
   - Keep the `main` branch deployable at all times.

### **3. Commit Prefixes**
**Why Prefixes Matter**:
Prefixes make commit histories readable and help filter changes by type (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`). Here‚Äôs what we use at THiNK:

| **Prefix** | **Use Case** | **Example** |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| `feat:` | New functionality | `feat: Add RAG query handler` |
| `fix:` | Bug fixes | `fix: Resolve model training timeout` |
| `model:` | ML model changes | `model: Train v3 of image classifier` |
| `deploy:` | Deployment updates | `deploy: Roll out rag-app to production` |
| `chore:` | Maintenance tasks | `chore: Update VSCode extensions` |
| `docs:` | Documentation changes | `docs: Add model training guide` |
| `test:` | Test additions/updates | `test: Add unit tests for model inference` |

**Pro Tip**: Use `git commit -m "feat: Add RAG query handler"` to save time.

---  

### **4. Branching Strategies**
- **Feature Branches**: Isolate work (e.g., `feat/rag-app`).
- **Hotfix Branches**: Quick fixes for production (e.g., `hotfix/critical-bug`).
- **Release Branches**: Prep for deployment (e.g., `release/v1.0`).

**Avoid**: Directly committing to `main` or `prod` branches.

---  

### **5. VSCode + Git Power-Ups**
- **Staging Changes**: Use the VSCode **Source Control panel** to stage/unstage files.
- **Commit Templates**: Configure VSCode to auto-suggest commit prefixes.
- **Pull Requests**: Open PRs directly from the editor.
- **GitHub Actions**: Trigger CI/CD pipelines (e.g., model testing, deployment) from VSCode.

**Example VSCode Shortcut**:
- Stage all changes: `Ctrl+Shift+A` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+A` (Mac).
- Commit: `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` (after typing the message).

---  

### **6. ML-Specific Practices**
- **Model Versioning**: Tag trained models in commits (e.g., `model: Train v3 - 92% accuracy`).
- **Experiment Tracking**: Use branches to isolate experiments (e.g., `exp/rag-new-dataset`).
- **Large Files**: Store models/datasets in **Git LFS** (Large File Storage) to avoid bloating the repo.
- **CI/CD for ML**: Automate model testing and deployment via GitHub Actions (e.g., *‚ÄúRun unit tests on push to feature branches‚Äù*).

**Example GitHub Action Snippet**:
```yaml  
name: Model Testing  
on: [push]  
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4  
      - run: python test_model.py  
```  

---  

### **7. Security & Best Practices**
- **Branch Protection**: Require PRs for `main`/`prod` branches.
- **Secrets Management**: Use GitHub Secrets for API keys, not hard-coded values.
- **Code Scanning**: Enable GitHub Advanced Security to catch vulnerabilities.
- **Access Control**: Limit write access to critical branches (e.g., `main`).

**Pro Tip**: Run `git log --graph --oneline` to audit changes before merging.

---  

### **8. Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- **Committing Non-Code Files**: Use `.gitignore` to exclude logs, temp files, and model artifacts.
- **Ignoring CI Failures**: Fix failing tests *before* merging.
- **Overloading Branches**: Keep branches focused‚Äîdon‚Äôt mix model training and UI fixes.

---  

### **9. Conclusion**
Version control at THiNK is about **clarity, collaboration, and speed**. By using Git prefixes, isolating work in branches, and leveraging VSCode/GitHub tools, we keep our projects organized and our team aligned‚Äîwhether we‚Äôre deploying a web app or fine-tuning a model.

**Real-Life Example**:
A developer trained a new model in a branch named `model/v3-training`. They committed with `model: Train v3 - 92% accuracy` and opened a PR. During review, a teammate spotted a data leakage issue. The fix took 1 hour‚Äîsaving weeks of retraining.

*Let‚Äôs keep our repos clean, our models sharp, and our workflows smooth!* üöÄ
