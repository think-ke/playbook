**Code Review Best Practices for the Tech Innovators Network (THiNK)**  
*Streamlined for collaboration, quality, and innovation‚Äîbuilt on Git, GitHub, and VSCode workflows.*

### **1. Introduction**  
Code reviews at THiNK are about **catching bugs early**, **sharing knowledge**, and **aligning on technical decisions**‚Äîespecially in our mix of ML projects, web apps, and databases. This guide focuses on the **review process itself**, while version control practices (e.g., commit prefixes, branching) are covered in our [Version Control Documentation](../version-control/version-control.md). Let‚Äôs make reviews a conversation, not a chore.

### **2. Submitting Code for Review**  
**What Authors Need to Do**:  
1. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**:  
   - Use a descriptive title (e.g., *‚ÄúRefactor model training pipeline for scalability‚Äù*).  
   - Link related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`) and include testing steps (see [Version Control Documentation](../version-control/version-control.md) for commit message templates).  

2. **Request Review**:  
   - Tag a colleague‚Äîpreferably someone **outside your immediate team**.  
   - If reviewing ML code, consider tagging someone with model deployment experience.  

3. **Stay Responsive**:  
   - Address feedback within **24 hours** of approval.  
   - If blocked, ping the reviewer or reassign the PR.  

**Example PR Template**:  
```  
# Refactor Model Training Pipeline  

**Goal**: Improve training speed for image classifiers.  

**Changes**:  
- Switched to distributed training.  
- Added monitoring for GPU usage.  

**Testing**:  
- Run `python test_training.py` to validate throughput.  
```

### **3. Reviewing Code**  
**What Reviewers Need to Do**:  
1. **Acknowledge Quickly**:  
   - Respond within **1 hour** (e.g., *‚ÄúI‚Äôll review this in 30 mins‚Äù*).  

2. **Focus on Impact**:  
   - Check for **security risks**, **performance bottlenecks**, and **maintainability**.  
   - For ML code:  
     - Are hyperparameters logged?  
     - Is the model versioned?  
     - Are deployment steps clear?  

3. **Use Inline Comments**:  
   - Flag issues directly (e.g., *‚ÄúThis might cause a memory leak‚Äîconsider using a generator‚Äù*).  

4. **Approve or Block**:  
   - Add a comment like *‚ÄúLGTM after addressing X and Y‚Äù*.  
   - Block merges if tests fail, security risks exist, or CI is red (see [Version Control Documentation](../version-control/version-control.md) for CI setup).  

**Example Review Comment**:  
```  
Looks solid, but:  
- Line 45: Add error handling for GPU allocation failures.  
- Ensure the model is saved to `models/v1` (see [Versioning Guide](#)).  
```

### **4. Best Practices**  
- **Turnaround Time**:  
  - Reviewers: Aim to complete reviews within **2 business days**.  
  - Authors: If a reviewer is unresponsive, tag another colleague.  

- **Knowledge Sharing**:  
  - Use reviews to teach (e.g., *‚ÄúDid you know about this VSCode extension for model profiling?‚Äù*).  

- **Handling Disagreements**:  
  - If stuck, escalate to a maintainer or open a team discussion.  

- **ML-Specific Checks**:  
  - Are training datasets versioned?  
  - Is the model tested on edge cases (e.g., rare input formats)?  

---  

### **5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid**  
- **Subjectivity**: Focus on objective issues (e.g., *‚ÄúThis code is hard to test‚Äù*), not style debates.  
- **Ignoring CI**: Never merge a PR with failing tests (see [Version Control Documentation](../version-control/version-control.md) for CI/CD).  
- **Overloading PRs**: Keep PRs small‚Äîsplit large changes into multiple reviews.  

---  

### **6. Conclusion**  
Code reviews at THiNK are a chance to **learn, teach, and ship better code**. By focusing on impact, staying responsive, and leveraging our ML expertise, we keep projects robust and collaborative.  

**Real-Life Example**:  
A developer merged a model training script without logging hyperparameters. A reviewer caught it, and the fix prevented a 2-week debugging nightmare.  

*Let‚Äôs keep reviews constructive‚Äîevery line of feedback matters.* üöÄ
