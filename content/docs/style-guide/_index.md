# Style Guide

This section contains our coding standards, development practices, and documentation guidelines. Following these standards ensures consistency across all THiNK projects and makes collaboration more effective.

## Development Standards

Our development process follows industry best practices with specific adaptations for our team's workflow and the THiNKiT Smart Speaker Platform.

### Core Principles

- **Consistency**: All code should follow the same patterns and conventions
- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting and easy to understand
- **Maintainability**: Write code that can be easily modified and extended
- **Quality**: Every change should improve the overall codebase quality

## Sections

### [Version Control](./version-control/)
Guidelines for Git workflows, branching strategies, and repository management. Learn about our Git conventions, commit message standards, and branch naming patterns.

### [Code Review](./code-review/)
Best practices for reviewing code, providing feedback, and maintaining code quality. Understand our review process, what to look for, and how to give constructive feedback.

### [Pull Requests](./pull-requests/)
Step-by-step guide for creating effective pull requests, including our PR template, review process, and merge requirements.

## Quick Reference

- **Branch naming**: `feature/description`, `bugfix/description`, `hotfix/description`
- **Commit messages**: Use conventional commits format
- **PR requirements**: All PRs must pass CI/CD and have at least one approval
- **Code formatting**: Use project-specific linting and formatting tools

## Getting Help

If you have questions about any of these guidelines or need clarification on best practices:

1. Check the relevant section in this style guide
2. Ask in the team Slack channel
3. Reach out to a team lead or mentor
4. Propose changes via PR if you think guidelines need updating

Remember, these guidelines are living documents that evolve with our team and projects.
